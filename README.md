## Audio player

Audio Player is an interactive web application developed based on React library with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query allows users to conveniently play and manage audio files. It gives the user the ability to play music, create playlists, control volume, rewind tracks, and more.

The main features are:
1. Audio Playback: React's audio player allows the user to select and play audio files from the server.
2. Playback Controls: Users have access to basic playback controls such as pause, play, fast-forward/fast-backward, move through the current track and skip to the next/previous track.
3. Create and manage playlists: Users can create their own playlists, add and remove tracks from them, and switch between different playlists to play music.
4. Volume and Sound: Users can adjust playback volume, and control sound settings such as mute/mute.
5. User Interface: The React audio player offers a user interface that provides ease of use, intuitive navigation, and displays information about the current track and playback time.

## Technology:
- React: The project is designed using the React library to build a component user interface and manage application state.
- HTML/CSS: Used to structure and style components and user interface layouts.
- JavaScript: Used to add additional functionality, event handling and audio playback control.
- Redux Toolkit: Used for managing application state, including storing information about playback, playlists and other data.
- RTK Query: Used to manage requests to the server and update data related to audio files using a flexible and convenient API.
- Material-UI: Allows an interface to be styled in a way that is simple and straightforward for developers and users.
- React-dropzone: Used to simplify pouring user files from their device.
- DND-kit: Used for editing the order of tracks in a playlist.


Benefits:
- Intuitive user interface for easy and convenient navigation.
- Support for playlists and track management.
- Flexible playback and sound settings.
- Scalable and expandable functionality.

React audio player project with Redux Toolkit, RTK Query and Material-UI is a powerful tool for playing and managing audio files with user-friendly interface and flexible functionality.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
